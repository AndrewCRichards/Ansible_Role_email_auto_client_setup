<!-- User: Optional
This tag gives user-specific information.  Autodiscover must be UTF-8 encoded.
-->
<User>
<!-- DisplayName: Optional
The server may have a good formal display name.  The client can decide to accept it or change it.  This will save the user time in the default case.
-->
<DisplayName>John Doe</DisplayName>
</User>

<!-- Account: Required
This tag specifies the type of account, such as Email vs Newsgroups, vs SIP server, etc.
-->
<Account>
<!-- AccountType: Required
This value indicates the type of the account.
VALUES:
email: The values under this Account tag indicate configuration settings for an email server.

<!-- Action: Required
This value indicates if the goal of this account results is to provide the settings or redirect to another web server that can provide results.
VALUES:
redirectUrl: If this value is specified, then the URL tag will specify the http: or https: URL containing the Autodiscover results to be used.  In order to prevent the server from being able to send the client into an infinite loop, the client should stop redirecting after 10 redirects.
redirectAddr: If this value is specified, then the XML tag will specify the e-mail address that Outlook should use to execute Autodiscover again.  In other words, the server is telling the client that the e-mail address the client should really be using for Autodiscover is not the one that was posted, but the one specified in this tag. 
settings: If this value is specified, then the XML will contain the settings needed to configure the account.  The settings will primarily be under the PROTOCOL tag.

<!-- Server: Required.
The value here specifies the name of the mail server corresponding to the server type specified above.

For protocols such as DAV or WEB, this will be an URL.
-->
<Server>mail.contoso.com</Server> <!--IP Addr or DNS name of server-->

<!-- Port: Optional.
The value specifies the Port number to use.  If no value is specified, the default settings will be used depending on the mail server type.  This value is not used if the SERVER tag contains an URL.
